# assembly-language

This is the code of the experimental course of the microcomputer experiment principle and interface technology of the School of Computer Science of Jilin University.

Note that this is the experimental code associated with the interface.

Many places in the code are related to wiring. If the ports are not the same, the port address may be different. At the same time, the inserted mouth is wrong, and it is impossible to observe the experimental phenomenon.

If there are two codes like 6_1 and 6_1_ME, where 6_1_ME is written by myself and the other can be found at www.redebug.com

这是吉林大学计算机学院微机实验原理与接口技术实验课程的代码

注意这是与接口有关的实验代码

代码中许多地方与接线有关，如果插的口不一样，那么端口地址可能不同。同时插的口不对，有可能观察不到实验现象

如果有两份代码比如6_1和6_1_ME，其中6_1_ME是我自己写的，另一个则可以在 www.redebug.com 中找到
